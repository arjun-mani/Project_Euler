Above is my code to over fifty problems on Project Euler ( http://projecteuler.net/about ) . Most of the solutions are in Java, although I have coded a few up in Python. I hope to expand on this as I solve problems.

Keep in mind that I am not sharing my code for the purpose of copy-and-pasting solutions, but rather to assist you with developing your own solutions. The whole point of Project Euler is to exercise your programming and algorithmic skills, not to copy others code. There is nothing that matches the satisfaction of solving a problem entirely by yourself.

Enjoy!

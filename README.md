**Project-Euler**
=================

Above is my code to over fifty problems on Project Euler ( http://projecteuler.net/about ) . Most of the solutions are in Java, although I have coded up a few in Python. I hope to expand on this as I solve more problems.

Keep in mind that I am not sharing my code for the purpose of copy-and-pasting solutions, but rather to assist you with developing your own solutions. The whole point of Project Euler is to exercise your programming and algorithmic skills, not to copy the code of others. There is nothing that matches the satisfaction of solving a problem entirely by yourself.

**Note on Problem 76**: I was experimenting with recursion, but the problem doesn't exactly offer up a solution. It generates all possible partitions of 100 -- I hope that might help guide you towards an answer.

Enjoy!
